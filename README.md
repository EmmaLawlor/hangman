# PROJECT NAME
Hangman

## Author
Emma Lawlor

## Project Overview
A simple interactive hangman game, written in Python. This game randomly chooses a word from a list of words. The user is then prompted to guess the letters of the word, or the word itself, until they have correctly identified the word or until they run out of lives. Each incorrect answer adds to the hangman image, with the game ending when the hangman has been fully completed.

## How To Play/Use
- On visiting the site, the game initialises with a "Let's Play Hangman" message
- Start by choosing a letter
- Keep guessing letters until the word is correctly completed or until all lives have been used and game is over. 
- Each time a letter is chosen, it is checked to see if it is correct/incorrect with the relevant message displayed to the user. 
- At the end of the game, play again by entereing 'Y' or finish the game by entering 'N'

## Features

### Implemented Features
- Start of game: On visiting the site, the user is greeted with a "Let's Play Hangman" message as well as an empty hangman image and the entire word represented by dashes, since the user has not yet made any guesses. The user is also prompted to guess a letter by asking for input "Choose a letter:"

- Input Validation: The user's chosen letter is checked against a number of conditions. 
  - If input is invalid, the user is alerted and prompted to choose again

  - If the user chooses a letter which is not in the word, the text is displayed in red and the hangman image is updated to the next stage indicating the loss of a life
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135350767-0ed0d1c3-6a91-43cb-8c1c-d5201f0b4d88.png)
  
  - If the user chooses a letter that they have already guessed, they are asked to try again without the loss of an extra life
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135351977-6df1edce-dbe8-4ae8-8567-6b31ff5c33b9.png)

- End of Game:
  - If the user has correctly completed the word or guessed the word, they get a congratulations message in green text and are asked if they want to play again
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135351418-5d434ad0-9fcd-4995-b86b-4afb0ea45472.png)
  
  - If the user fails to guess the word correctly, they get a game over message in red text and are asked if they would like to play again
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135351558-030edaa5-2956-44fb-b69e-3fda96f1a665.png)

  - If the user chooses not to play the game their result is displayed in terms of number of games won out of total number of games played
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135351720-14d29960-a874-4f58-ad78-34bb79e5afbc.png)
  
 - Data Collection:
 
     - In designing the game, every effort was made to try to ensure successful collection of data from the user when choosing a letter. 
     - Letters are used in their lowercase format by using the .lower() method on the user's input. Because of this, user's can enter both upper or lowercase letters, with the game functioning normally in all scenarios. 
     - Any leading or trailing spaces before or after the user's guessed letter is trimmed using the .strip() method. This ensures that even if user's accidentally enter spaces, only the letter entered will by evaluated as their guess. 
     - The application of both of these methods to the user's input enhances the user experience. They ensure that these minor r#typing errors can be overlooked by the app and that the game will fucntion as expected when they are encountered.

### Future Features

- Score Tracking: By linking with Google Sheets, the game could ask the user for their name and email address, store their score details and email them a copy of their results upon exiting the game. 
- Personalied Messages: Through use of a 'user' class, the game could collect the user's first name and use this to personalise the welcome message and the end of game text. 
- Rules: At the start of the game, the user could be given the option to have the rules of Hangman displayed, explaining how to play the game. 

## Design Documents

- In the early planning stages, a flowchart was drawn up to help visualise the steps required to create a functioning hangman game. 
- This chart was helpful to the developer when creating functions as the logic of the game was clearly broken down into simple steps.
- [This flowchart](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AtrJulJDGsm2qFf5wKQGuJDN1MRH) was created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=_chart_en_tier1_mixed_search_brand_exact_&km_CPC_CampaignId=1490375427&km_CPC_AdGroupID=55688909257&km_CPC_Keyword=lucidcharts&km_CPC_MatchType=e&km_CPC_ExtensionID=&km_CPC_Network=g&km_CPC_AdPosition=&km_CPC_Creative=442433236001&km_CPC_TargetID=aud-826163889020:kwd-84176206937&km_CPC_Country=20483&km_CPC_Device=c&km_CPC_placement=&km_CPC_target=&mkwid=sMDuh5elr_pcrid_442433236001_pkw_lucidcharts_pmt_e_pdv_c_slid__pgrid_55688909257_ptaid_aud-826163889020:kwd-84176206937_&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1ouKBhC5ARIsAHXNMI-XHJRavE5VCyXoRZMUJrufGkLIFrq_iz1oKO4xAXMed81uEqSRagMaAsA5EALw_wcB)

## Data Model

The class 'Hangman' is used as the data model for the game. 

The __init__ method initialises the following attributes for use in all instances of the class:
- self.word: uses the random method to choose a random word from the provided list in the words.py file. This is the word used for gameplay, which the user will try to decipher by guessing letters.
- self.stage: Used to display the correct version of the 'Hangman' image. The stage is incremented by 1 each time the user enters an incorrect letter, therefore displaying the next stage of the hangman each time an incorrect letter is entered.
- self.guessed_letters: An empty list, to which all letters guessed by the user throughout the course of a game are added. This list is vital in gameplay, as it allows us to check if the user has already guessed the letter. If the letter has already been guessed, the user is advised of this and is asked to choose again. 
- self.guessed_words: As with guessed_words, this starts as an empty list. If the user chooses to guess an entire word, it is then added to this list. If they guess another word, this list is used to check if the wprd has already been guessed. 
- self.games_played: Starting at 0, this number is increased by 1 each time the user completes a game. 
- self.games_won: Again starting at 0, this is increased by 1 each time the user correctly completes the word and wins the game. A combination of games_played and games_won are used to return the user's overall result for the session when they choose to exit the game.  


## Libraries used
- Random module imported to allow the program to select a random word from the words.py file for use in gameplay. 
- Colorama module imported to allow styling and coloring of text displayed to the user in the terminal. This was used to enhance the user's experience and make the game more visually attractive. 
  - The main game text is yellow, with the hangman image and dashes representing letters are cyan.

## Testing

### Validation Testing

Both Python files of this repository were checked using the [Pep8Online](http://pep8online.com/) validator.

1.  The run.py file returned a number of errors for lines of code being too long, over 79 characters, as seen here. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135769749-385a30a8-2f20-4b70-8a26-34168ac6e5a6.png)

These warnings were overwritten by adding '  # noqa' to the end of each line which was identified as being too long, as shown below. This tells the linter to gnore any issues with the particular line. It was decided not to break the the code into shorter lines for readability and future maintainability of the file. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135770089-3ecf6934-c4a8-43ca-9ab9-3cc6cb6a8844.png)

This eliminated all previous errors and on rechecking the run.py file, no errors were found in the code.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135770124-bc7d56e8-3817-4d16-a347-579cd3b7f1cc.png)

2. The words.py file returned a large number of errors and warnings, relating to formatting of the list of words. The list was no properly indented, in line with the square brackets and several list items had trailing whitespace. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135770395-1b3c44d3-e910-4293-aa2a-87239f5214ff.png)

This was corrected by moving all list items in by 1 space to align with the square brackets. All instances of trailing whitesoace identified by the linter were deleted. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135770683-160a6171-0069-47c2-ac70-b932aab1dc87.png)

These changes corrected all errors and warnings and rec-checking the words.py file returned no errors.

### Manual Testing

A template for test cases was created in the GitHub repository for this project. All instances of possible correct/incorrect user input was tested and results recorded using these test case templates. The testing can be found in the GitHub Issues section [here](https://github.com/EmmaLawlor/hangman/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)


### Defect Tracking

### Defects of Note
- Any defects which occurred during development were tracked using the GitHub Issues section of this repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/EmmaLawlor/hangman/issues).

- Details of each bug were noted as they were discovered, with screenshots taken to demonstrate the problem where possible.
- Some other minor bugs which occured during development were not documented in this way as they were extremely quick and simple to fix. 
- The GitHub Issues section allowed for closeout of defects as they were rectified, again using screenshots to show the solution when possible.

### Outstanding Defects
- No outstanding defects have been noted. 

## Commit History

On review of this repository, an error in git commit messages was noted. For a time, when editing the README file directly in GitHub, the commit message was mistakenly entered in the 2nd entry field for optional extra data as seen here.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135771796-21da2f27-e1b4-4c5c-b338-436e463b8912.png)

This has resulted in the following main message for some commits.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135771827-e9cfb19a-7fa8-482d-b803-d0da2eaee8e7.png)

The intended commit message can be seen by clicking the ... beside the main message, as seen here.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84344402/135771851-1e131e1c-dab8-4dd2-8178-22578352f9dc.png)

Though this was noticed and corrected going forward, it was decided not to edit the effected commit messages. On researching the topic, while I learned it is possible to change commit messages, it is not recommended as it can confuse the commit history and make future development difficult.
